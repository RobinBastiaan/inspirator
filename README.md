## About
This small web page plugin, that is heavily integrated to work on the PBworks platform, provides a convenient search for a sutable scouting program.

## Installation & Inner workings
As said, this project is build to be used on the PBworks platform. This platform does come with its quirks and limitations that had to be built around with.
- For the CSS and the JS to work, it has to be added as a plugin on a PBworks page.
- Since the platform does not allow large plugins, the script has to be copied over in smaller chuncks.
- When editing a PBworks page, all plugins are not executed. This allows the source table to be hidden via CSS for a clean and easy way for users to edit it.
